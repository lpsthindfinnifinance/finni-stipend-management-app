Background:
We the Finni health manage 60+ ABA practices and have a system in place to provide stipend to practice owners.
The stipend is calculated based on gross margin % and Collections % (0.6GM% + 0.4 Collections%). This data is updated at 14 days (pay period) interval and the stipend eliginbilt (cap) for each practice will chang each pay period. This base data will flow from Big query.

All 60 practices roll into 5 portfolios and each portforlio has a Practice Success Manage (PSM).

Now we decide steipend eligibility based on practice metrcis as mentioned above however PSM's can decide what sipend to be provided to which practice however they should remain withing the total stipend allowed for their portfolio (their practices).

A PSM can allocate stipend to other PSM who is short on the stipend.

For stipend request - PSM should submit a request (form) which will be approved first by him and then by lead PSM and then by Finance team. We need slack channel alerts for this.

Stipend can be one time or recurring till Pay Period 26 (2025)

We need to keep records of Opening stipend balance (as of today)

Any additions or deductions on remeasurement at the end of pay period
Stipend already requested by PSM
a. Already paid till last pay period
b. Committed for next pay periods
+/- Any allocations by PSMs to other PSM (this showuld be tied at clinic level)
Point to note: Portfolio will remain same (G1, G2, G3, G4, G5) however PSM may change lateon for protfolio AND A practice in this payperiod tied to G1 may be moved to G3 in the upcomming pay periods so make provision for this.
