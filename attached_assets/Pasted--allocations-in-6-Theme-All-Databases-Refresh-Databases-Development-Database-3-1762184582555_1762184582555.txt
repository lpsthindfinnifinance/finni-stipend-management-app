I'm finance user currently tagged to G3 Portfolio AS psm - WHEN i CLICK ON request ID 6 in inter-porfolio - Out table - it should a page where I can appliy funds so the page it is showung actually related to Inter portfolio - In allocations when I click on Inter - portfolio out allocations. this should not be the case, all Inter-portfolio - Out allocations should have details page showing on out allocatios details and all Intern-Portfolio - In transactions showing for my portfolio should have detail page showing page for In transactions only.

I understand the issue! When you click on an **Inter-portfolio OUT** allocation (one you sent to another portfolio), it's incorrectly showing the distribution form. That form should only appear for **Inter-portfolio IN** allocations (ones sent to your portfolio). Let me fix this:

Wait - I'm still seeing the in page should on out transactions (ID6) - the reason may be when I created out allocation, I was tagged to Portfolio 1 so Out allocation was made from portfolio 1 practices but allocation was made to G3 portfolio. and now I've switched my self to portfolio 3. that may be the reason why it is showing 'In' page on inter portfolio - out allocation.

Do the following:
Create separate page for Out allocations and In allocations details.

For PSMs: on Out allocation page, show allocations where they made allocations from their currently tAGGED portfolio to other portfolios. (not all allocations)
and In allocations - In table should show allocations recieved from other portfolios to PSM's current portfolio. (not all in alllocations)

You're absolutely right! The issue is that you created the allocation when tagged to Portfolio 1, but now you're tagged to Portfolio 3 (the recipient), so it's showing as an IN allocation. We need separate pages that filter by the user's CURRENT portfolio tag. Let me create separate detail pages for IN and OUT allocations:

why this dropdown (Add Practices to Distribution) is showing all practices? instead it should show practices in portfolio that I'm tagged to
